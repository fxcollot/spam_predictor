## Executive Summary
This project implements a modular, enterprise-grade Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline designed to detect spam across varying communication mediums (SMS and Email). 

Moving beyond experimental notebooks, this repository demonstrates a **production-first architecture**. It addresses the specific challenges of text classification: high dimensionality, domain shift (the difference between SMS and Email vocabulary), and the trade-off between Precision and Recall.

The final system achieves **~95% F1-Score** on combined datasets using a Linear SVC architecture with TF-IDF vectorization, orchestrated via MLflow for experiment tracking.

## Architecture
The project adheres to "Separation of Concerns" principles. Below is the high-level data flow from raw text to model inference.
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Data SMS/Email] -->|Ingest| B(DataProcessor)
    B -->|Split Train/Test| C{TextPreprocessor}
    C -->|Tokenize & Vectorize| D[Feature Matrix]
    D -->|Train| E[ModelTrainer]
    E -->|Log Metrics| F((MLflow))
    E -->|Predict| G[Evaluator]
    G -->|Generate Report| H[Artifacts]
```

The codebase is organized into reusable class-based components:

* **`src/pipeline/data_processor.py`**: Handles data ingestion, cleaning, and splitting. Manages the complexity of merging disparate datasets (SMS vs. Email).
* **`src/pipeline/text_preprocessor.py`**: A configurable engine for tokenization, normalization (casing), stop-word removal, and vectorization (Bag of Words vs. TF-IDF).
* **`src/pipeline/model_trainer.py`**: Wraps Scikit-Learn estimators with MLflow auto-logging, handling hyperparameter injection and model persistence.
* **`src/pipeline/evaluator.py`**: Calculates comprehensive metrics (Precision, Recall, F1) and generates artifact visualizations (Confusion Matrices).

## Key Insights & Performance Analysis

### 1. Model Selection & Efficiency 

![Model Performance Comparison](images/by_model.png)

We benchmarked four distinct architectures: Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Linear SVC, and Random Forest.

**Performance Comparison**: *Result: Linear SVC and Logistic Regression performed comparably well in accuracy.*

![Training Duration Analysis](images/training_duration_by_model.png)

**Training Duration**: *Result: While Random Forest is robust, it is ~2x slower than Linear SVC. **Linear SVC** was chosen as the production model for its optimal speed-to-performance ratio.*

### 2. The "Domain Shift" Challenge (SMS vs. Email)
A critical experiment involved training on one domain and testing on another to evaluate model generalization.
* **SMS Trained $\to$ Email Tested:** Resulted in poor performance (Recall: ~0.385). The model learned SMS-specific slang (e.g., "txt", "free") but failed to recognize formal email spam patterns.
* **Combined Training $\to$ Email Tested:** Performance spiked to **~0.95 Precision/Recall**.
* **Insight:** Data diversity is more critical than model complexity. A simple model on diverse data beats a complex model on narrow data.

### 3. Feature Engineering Strategy
We performed extensive A/B testing on preprocessing configurations.

#### Vectorization (Count vs TF-IDF):
* **Insight**: **TF-IDF** (Pink) consistently outperformed standard Count Vectorization (Grey). By penalizing common words that appear in all documents, the model focuses on "rare" spam indicators.

#### Stop-Words Impact:
* **Insight**: Removing stop words (using NLTK) versus keeping them showed minimal difference in Accuracy, but keeping them slightly improved context in some edge cases.

#### Optimization Trade-offs (Precision vs Recall):
* **Strategy**: In this iteration, `GridSearchCV` parameters resulted in a model biased towards **Recall** (Blue bars).
* **Business Logic**: We prioritized catching all spam (High Recall) at the cost of occasionally flagging legitimate emails. For a user-centric product, future iterations would re-balance for Precision.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* `uv` (Python package manager)

### 1. Setup
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2. Running the Pipeline
The pipeline is triggered via the main entry point. You can run specific experiments or the full production flow.

- Run the standard training pipeline

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_pipeline
```

- Run the automatised wrappers for the standard pipeline

```bash
# For Grid Search
uv run python scripts/run_grid_search_pipeline.py

# For one or more exact parameters
uv run python scripts/run_automatic_pipeline.py
```

### 3. MLflow Tracking
To visualize experiment results, compare runs, and view artifacts (confusion matrices):

```bash
uv run mlflow ui
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

### 4. Testing & Validation

To ensure the integrity of the pipeline and verify that all components (DataProcessor, TextPreprocessor, etc.) function as expected, we have included a comprehensive test suite.

Run the automated test suite using:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_tests.py
```
